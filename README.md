# Dragomino Ai

Graphic interface to assist with the playing of the game [Dragomino](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/spiele/dragomino/).

Calculates probabilities on the fly. 
Even includes a basic predition method trying to advise on the best placement of the next tile.

Prediction is not very sophisicated as of now, because more time was spent getting the ui ready then I thought.

# History
This was done as a time-passing project during a vacation on a mountain hut. 
Therefore the challange basically was not to google anything, as the is basically no network connection.
As of this, some of the code may be a little rough around the edges.

# Installation
To be run locally, this needs `python3` as well as the python library `tkinter`.
Otherwise no dependencies are needed.

Just run the `main.py` script:
```
python main.py
```
